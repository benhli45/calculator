# calculator
a python calculator built off the windows calculator. Have yet to work out the memory buttons or the percent feature.
Not exactly sure where to find examples to add this bit of functionality. Also, at some point would add a field above 
the typed display showing what's going on in the calculator, such as whether addition is taking place, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, or percentage (be it for tips, tax, etc).

Any and all help is thanked on this.
